      <Heading>90 Day Comfort Guarantee</Heading>
      <P>
        It will take anywhere from 30 to 90 nights for your new mattress to break in and for your body
        to adjust to the new support and comfort. Because of this, we ask that you sleep on your new mattress
        for a minimum of 30 nights to allow for adjustment. However, if you are not comfortable
        within 90 days of your original mattress’s delivery date, you may exchange or return your mattress one time in this period.
      </P>
      <P>
        Delivery and set up fees are non-refundable. We do not charge restocking fees, only a redelivery fee of $79.99.
        E.S.C. Mattress Center is unable to exchange or refund any mattress that is stained, soiled,
        or in any way damaged by you under this guarantee. Do not remove the Law Label from your mattress
        or foundation, doing so will void your 90 Day Comfort Guarantee. Please be aware that our Comfort
        Guarantee does not cover clearance merchandise, floor models, warranty exchanges, furniture,
        adjustable bases, pillows, mattress protectors, or other accessories. See associate for more details.
      </P>
      <Heading>Low Price Guarantee</Heading>
